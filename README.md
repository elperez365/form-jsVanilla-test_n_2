# Good Vibes Form Challenge

![Design preview for the Good Vibes Form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking on this front-end coding challenge focused on creating an interactive form with various input types.

**To successfully complete this challenge, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The Challenge

Your mission is to construct a "Good Vibes Form" by implementing a variety of input elements, including text fields, email, number, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, a textarea, and new additions like range, date, and color pickers. Your goal is to closely replicate the provided design, ensuring responsiveness and interactive states.

Users should be able to:

- View the form layout optimized for different screen sizes.
- Experience interactive elements with appropriate hover states.
- Submit the form, displaying a message or triggering any desired action (you can simulate this behavior without an actual backend).

## Building Your Project

Feel free to use any tools or workflow that suits you. While there's a suggested process, adapt it based on your preferences:

1. Carefully review the designs to plan your approach, considering the creation of reusable CSS classes for consistent styling.
2. Before applying styles, structure your content using HTML. Starting with HTML can help maintain a focus on creating well-organized content.
3. Implement the base styles for your project, covering general content styles like `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Progressively add styles from the top of the page downward, ensuring each section meets your satisfaction before moving on to the next.
